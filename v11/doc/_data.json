In this example, the interface defines two operations, both of which have numeric inputs and outputs representing temperature in different scales. The interface is stored as a standard WSDL document. An editor is provided to show the interface, and help you build or change it. Each operation is implemented as a subflow, using the built-in Mapping nodes to transform the incoming requests."
